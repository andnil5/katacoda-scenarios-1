# Executable tutorial: CI workflow using GitHub actions for Node.js Express app, including automated testing and linting using Jest and ESLint

This tutorial will go through the steps of setting up a pre-built Express application that we then use to set up automatic testing with `Jest` and `Supertest` and linting with `ESLint`, explaining the fundamentals of testing and linting in the process. Finally, we apply our newly aquired knowledge, when we set up `continous integration (CI)` with testing/linting using `Github-actions`.

#### This tutorial has the following structure:
1. Express application overview
2. Automated testing with `Jest` and `Supertest`
  1. Intro to automated testing `Jest`/ `Supertest`
  2. Show how to write automated mocha tests with `Jest` / `Supertest`
3. Static code analysis with ESLint
4. Continous Integration with GitHub Actions
  1. Show how to run automated tests and linting in a CI workflow using GitHub actions.
