This tutorial will go through the steps of setting up a pre-built Express application that we then use to set up automatic testing with `Jest` and `Supertest` and linting with `ESLint`, explaining the fundamentals of testing and linting in the process. Finally, we apply our newly acquired knowledge when we set up `continuous integration (CI)` with testing/linting using `GitHub Actions`.

#### This tutorial has the following structure:
1. 
2. Express application overview and set up
3. Introduction to API endpoints testing with Jest and Supertest
4. Automated integration testing for API endpoints with Jest and Supertest
5. Mocking the data model
6. Static code analysis with ESLint
7. Continous Integration with GitHub Actions
8. Show how to run automated tests and linting in a CI workflow using GitHub Actions
