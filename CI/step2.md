### Intro to automated testing `Jest` and `Supertest`

`Jest` is a JavaScript testing framework that enables users to write automated tests for JavaScript projects. `Jest` is compatible with several well-known JavaScript framworks such as TypeScript, Node, React, Angular and Vue.
`Jest` allows developers to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API giving quick results.

#### Why `Jest`:
- Well documented API
- Requires minimal configuration
- Runs test in parallell in their own processes to increase performance.

#### Mocking with `Jest`

TO BE UPDATED - "In unit testing, mocks provide us with the capability to stub the functionality provided by a dependency and a means to observe how our code interacts with the dependency. Mocks are especially useful when it's expensive or impractical to include a dependency directly into our tests, for example, in cases where your code is making HTTP calls to an API or interacting with the database layer.

Jest - Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. It works out of the box with minimal configuration and has in-built test runner, assertion library and mocking support.

Supertest - A library for testing Node.js HTTP servers. It enables us to programmatically send HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE to HTTP servers and get results."
