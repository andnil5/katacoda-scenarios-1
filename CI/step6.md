The next step is to incorporate static code analysis in our project to mitigate syntax errors or problems with formatting. As stated in the introduction, this will be performed with ESLint.

#### Installation

Install ESLint with npm: `npm install eslint --save-dev`{{execute}}. Make sure that you are in the `server` folder before running this command.

**Note:** Installation could also be performed with `yarn`, [more information](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started).

Next, create the configuration file `.eslintrc.json` in the current directory by running: `npx eslint --init`{{execute}}

Configure the project as follows:

    ✔ How would you like to use ESLint?
       -> To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style

    ✔ What type of modules does your project use?
       -> CommonJS (require/exports)

    ✔ Which framework does your project use?
       -> None of these

    ✔ Does your project use TypeScript?
       -> No

    ✔ Where does your code run?
       -> Node

    ✔ How would you like to define a style for your project?
       -> Use a popular style guide

    ✔ Which style guide do you want to follow?
       -> Google: https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google
  
    ✔ What format do you want your config file to be in?
       -> JSON


Choose Yes when prompted to install the dependency `eslint-config-google@latest`.

    ✔ Would you like to install them now with npm?
       -> Yes

#### Running

To ease linting, we define two new scripts in the file `package.json`. Click on `Copy to Editor` below to add the scripts. If you want to do this manually, replace `insert-lint": ""` with the content below in the same file.

<pre class="file" data-filename="server/package.json" data-target="insert" data-marker='"insert-lint": ""'>
"lint": "eslint 'src/**/*.js'",
    "lint:fix": "eslint 'src/**/*.js' --fix"</pre>

Run: `npm run lint`{{execute}} to lint all files in the `src` directory.

The linter will catch a few formatting errors. Let's fix them automatically by running: 
`npm run lint:fix`{{execute}}

Run `npm run lint`{{execute}} once again to check that the errors have been resolved.

#### Custom rules (optional)

ESLint is highly customizable and lets you define custom rules that work alongside the built-in rules. Create a custom rule by updating the `rules` tag in the config file `.eslintrc.json` with the following content. This could be done manually or by clicking on `Copy to Editor` below.
<pre class="file" data-filename="server/.eslintrc.json" data-target="insert" data-marker='"rules": {
    }'>
"rules": { "quotes": ["error", "double"] }</pre>

**Note:** The file `.eslintrc.json` is hidden by default.

The rule enforces the source code always to use double-quotes and not single-quotes. The change introduces a few new errors since the source code includes a few single quotes.

Run `npm run lint`{{execute}}, the see the introduced error.

Fix the errors `npm run lint:fix`{{execute}}

Click on `Copy to Editor` below to remove the newly added rule.

<pre class="file" data-filename="server/.eslintrc.json" data-target="insert" data-marker='"rules": { "quotes": ["error", "double"] }'>
"rules": { }</pre>

Reset the source code to use single quotes `npm run lint:fix`{{execute}}
